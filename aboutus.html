				<h2>Our Founder:</h2>
				<p>Our Founder is Kyle Everett who created this group while completing his last year of university studying a bachelor of IT. While studying, he found out about the wonders of open source software and became heavily interested in Linux and the GNU project, deciding to make software that is open sourced and free as in freedom. His goal is to break the chains of properitary software and has made great strides with his magnum opus the Universal Tagging system <a href="oursoftware.html">(psst, check out the UTS and other amazing software here"</a>. Over the past ten years he has been honing his skills and becoming a leader in free software.
				<p id="quote">"I believe in the freedom of your software, that user should have control over their computer. Developers make the playground, users get to decide how to use it"</p>
