				<h2>MEET THE TEAM</h2>
				<p>Edge Software is committed to a diverse range of people and ideas to create what we and our users consider the best software. Single focusing on one idea will lead to disaster, letting us have a loose leadership structure, everyone is a contributor and idea maker, there is no one person who is the star of the show. That has been the philosophy of our founder Kyle Everett. Proffesional and committed to our ideals and morals, we are the gold standard of FOSS development. <a href="aboutus.html">Come meet the team!</a></p>
