  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Kyle Everett</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Goal is to promote 100Smiles dental care and inform people of what they offer</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>To see an uptick in new patients, preferably juding average number of new patients before and after the launch of this website over a period of time.</p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>This website will primarily target middle aged people and older, for this range includes parents of small children and seniors that experience more dental troubles. The reason for this is that it covers the key demograpics the client seems to consitently talk about in their introductory email, covering "everyone" while also homing into a specific group.</p>
